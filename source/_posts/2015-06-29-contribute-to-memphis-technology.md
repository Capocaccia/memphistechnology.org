We recently picked up a new front end theme for our website and are currently working on implementing it.

We need your help!

We're looking for someone (or some people!) to help build out our new website. You can see the source to our site on [Github](https://github.com/memtech/memphistechnology.org)

Technologies we use:

* HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
* Twig template engine
* Sculpin.io (PHP static site generator) to build the site.

Send us an email to board at memphistechnology.org and we'll get send you the theme files and get you started!
