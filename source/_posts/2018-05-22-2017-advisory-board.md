<h2>An ongoing experiment doing well</h2>
<p>
In March 2017 the MTF board decided to reach out to a couple of active volunteers in the local community to establish an advisory board to help offload some tasks. The advisory board started with two and has now grown to six members and has served MTF very well. It's long past time to recognize these great volunteers: <a href="/about/advisory-board">Memphis Technology Foundation Advisory Board</a>.
