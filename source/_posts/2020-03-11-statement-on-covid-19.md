Hello #memtech!

The Memphis Technology Foundation has been watching the news about Coronavirus (COVID-19) and based on several cities' actions of limiting gatherings, the WHO declaring COVID-19 a pandemic, we feel that it may be in the communities' best interest to cancel meet ups for the rest of the month to reduce potential exposure. We leave the decision up to the individual user group leaders so please continue to monitor <a href="https://memphistechnology.org/blog/2015/05/19/join-memtech-on-slack-chat/" target="_blank">Memphis Technology User Groups Meetup</a> for any group cancellations or updates. We suggest groups try to teleconference as much as possible to continue sharing the great content and ideas this community is known for across the different groups.

We have decided to cancel the Wednesday East Memphis lunch and coworking events for the rest of March.

If you're missing the community please <a href="https://memphistechnology.org/blog/2015/05/19/join-memtech-on-slack-chat/" target="_blank">join us in slack</a>

Take care of yourselves, and wash your hands :D
