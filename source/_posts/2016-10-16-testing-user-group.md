The FedEx Institute of Technology in partnership with the Software Testing
Excellence Program and the Department of Business Information Technology at the
University of Memphis are pleased to announce the Testing User Group meeting
monthly to discuss the challenges of creating a successful testing environment
to ensure that your software, applications, and other testable products are put
through the latest in standards of excellence.

Every month we will meet at **4 pm (speaker presentation starts at 4:30 pm) at
Expedient located at 3180 Players Lane in Germantown**. This month, our meeting
is on <a href="https://memphis.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4MxTQQF10HzhpCl">OCTOBER 20th</a>
and features the Director of the STEP program outlining some
of the research and testing efforts going on right now at the University of
Memphis. This is a great opportunity to come and learn what testing is, why it
is critical to good design, and ask lots of questions to people who have lots
of answers. Also, as a bonus, free beer and food for everyone. Come join the
best testing community in the world.

The Systems Testing Excellence Program (STEP) is a major interdisciplinary
research initiative under the umbrella of the FedEx Institute of Technology
with academic program support from UofM Departments of Business Information &amp;
Technology and Computer Science, who are tasked with building up research and
curricular competencies that will help position the university and the city of
Memphis as a national and internationally recognized thought-leader in the
science of systems testing. To achieve this, STEP in collaboration with FedEx
is creating a hub for testers and QA specialists by providing a forum for
learning and knowledge sharing about the latest ideas in software testing.
