On June 18th the White House will hold it's first ever [Maker Faire](http://www.whitehouse.gov/maker-faire). You can watch the stream live on the day of the event.

June 17th, President Obamba said:


> I am proud to host the first-ever White House Maker Faire. This event celebrates every maker â€” from students learning STEM skills to entrepreneurs launching new businesses to innovators powering the renaissance in American manufacturing. I am calling on people across the country to join us in sparking creativity and encouraging invention in their communities.

The [Mayors Maker Challenge](http://mac.madwolf.com/sites/default/files/Mayors_Challenge_Launch_Letter_.pdf) was a challenge issued to mayors to support and promote their local emereging Maker Movement. If you are not familiar with [our own Maker Movement](http://www.memphisflyer.com/memphis/making-it-in-memphis/Content?oid=3527481), [MidsouthMakers](http://www.midsouthmakers.org), I encourage you to visit them this Friday night and see what they have going on.
 
 MidsouthMakers recently [won a Shapeoko CNC](https://twitter.com/midsouthmakers/status/473879870003355648) machine so they have brand new toys to play with.
