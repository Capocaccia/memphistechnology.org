In celebration of the 1st anniversary of Memphis Technology Foundation many of the #memtech User Groups will be joining together for another Super User Group Meeting on April 14th. 

We will have 4-6 presenters doing 10-20 minute talks on topics that are relevant to the larger group. This will be a great event for all interested in technology. Many of the user groups that meet monthly will be using this as their April meet up. 

Come meet and network with members of the diverse local user groups. If you'd like to give a talk, please email brad@memphistechnology.org
