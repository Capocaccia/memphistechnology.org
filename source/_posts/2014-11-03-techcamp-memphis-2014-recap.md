The [TechCamp Memphis](http://techcampmemphis.com) happened last Saturday and was well received by all in attendance. If you attended any of the great talks [please rate them](https://joind.in/event/view/2853)!

TechCamp Memphis 2014 was a special event for Memphis Technology Foundation(MTF). TechCamp was our first official event as MTF.

We have heard a lot of great things about TechCamp this year. Eric Terpstra wrote a great recap of [TechCamp 2014](http://blog.ericterpstra.com/techcamp-memphis-2014/)

Thanks to all of the people that helped make TechCamp happen. We were able to work with really great [Sponsors](http://techcampmemphis.com/2014/11/03/thanks-to-the-techcamp-2014-sponsors/), [Speakers](http://techcampmemphis.com/2014/11/03/thanks-to-the-techcamp-2014-speakers/), and [Organizers & Volunteers](http://techcampmemphis.com/2014/11/03/thanks-to-the-techcamp-2014-organizers-volunteers/)
