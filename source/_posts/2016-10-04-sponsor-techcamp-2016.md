<a href="http://www.techcampmemphis.org" target="_blank">TechCamp Memphis</a> is a one-day educational and networking event for design and IT professionals boasting three simultaneous tracks of programming focusing on design, development, and marketing. This yearâ€™s event will be on November 5, 2016, at the Fedex Institute of Technology. The doors open at 8:30 for registration and breakfast. We also serve lunch, and the event wraps up by 4.

Even single day events like this one, can be expensive to produce. We need your help to make it happen! Help us support and strengthen the technical community in Memphis by becoming a sponsor today!

We offer three levels of sponsorship, with benefits including social media mentions, reserved tickets for Tech Camp, and pitch time during our opening presentation.
