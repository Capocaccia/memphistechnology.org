On July 26th the Memphis Chapter of Black Girls Code will host a new game development class at New Horizons Computer Learning Center. 


> This workshop will focus on game development using Beta (http://betathegame.com/), an open game world that allows players to easily play, create and share games.  Taught by subject matter experts from Hidden Level Games, the New York-based indie game studio, the Memphis workshop will be geared towards introducing participants to animation, gaming, and creating shared interactive experiences. The workshop is designed to encourage student-driven learning, as participants think analytically, design, play, and code in real-time. No prior programming experience is required for this class.
> This class is designed for girls ages 10 - 17.
