Tuesday December 16th the Memphis Technology Foundation's board will convene officially for the first time to discuss a lenghty agenda of items from a recap of 2014 and our 2015 plans.

We will also be discussing our filling for 501(c)(3) status, Upcoming events, and fundraising goals.

Any interested parties are welcome to join, however there will be an agenda that will likely dominate most of the meeting time. Anyone interested is encouraged to attend.
