In case you haven't [heard](http://www.peeblesfuneralhome.com/obits/obituary.php?id=579040), Memphis lost a beloved and highly-respected community member this weekend. Dave Barger, Jr. was first and foremost a family man, but a close second was his drive to make Memphis a better place. The amount of time and effort he put into that personal mission is easy to see by his community involvement.

* Founder and CEO of Lunaweb
* Founding board member of LaunchMemphis (now StartCo)
* Creator of Social Media Expedition Breakfast (now Interactive Expedition Breakfast) 
* Founding board member and president of GEEK Memphis
* Planner/co-planner of countless tech and startup events in Memphis

As news of his passing rippled through the Memphis technology (#memtech) community, many of us struggled with how to deal with the sudden loss. A great mentor, leader, and friend to so many of us, his impact on Memphis is [apparent](https://twitter.com/search?q=%40davebarger%20OR%20%23RememberDave&src=typd), and the mark he left on our community will not be forgotten. 

Once we begin to come to terms with our personal grief and sense of loss, we must remember that Dave leaves a wife and two young daughters. The #memtech and StartCo startup communities will come together to raise money to help build a college fund for Dave's daughters. Please consider donating, especially if Dave impacted your life in any way, directly or indirectly.

Donations can be made directly to the "Dave Barger Memorial College Fund" at any Trustmark bank.
