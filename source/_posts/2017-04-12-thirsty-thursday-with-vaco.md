On May 11, 2017 at 5:30 PM <a href="http://www.vacomemphis.com" target="_blank">Vaco Memphis</a> will host their first #ThirstyThursday 
event at <a href="https://www.cityandstate.us/" target="_blank">City & State</a> on Broad Ave. This free event will feature tacos by the 
<a href="http://fuelcafememphis.com/fuel-food-truck" target="_blank">Fuel Food Truck</a>, with beer by Memphis' own 
<a href="http://www.wiseacrebrew.com/" target="_blank">Wiseacre Brewery</a>. Wine will also be available. Details are still in the works, 
but Vaco is planning to host some games (possibly with prizes), so show up ready to win!

Vaco events are a great opportunity to meet more members of the Memphis technology community and expand your professional network while enjoying 
good food and drinks with a fun group of people. This is the first of what will hopefully be many more Vaco sponsored community events.
