<h1>What is GiveCamp Memphis / Design for Good?</h1>

GiveCamp Memphis / Design for Good is a weekend-long event where professionals from designers, developers and database administrators to marketers and web strategists donate their time to provide solutions for nonprofit organizations. Since its inception in 2007, the national GiveCamp program has provided benefits to hundreds of nonprofits, worth millions of dollars of developer and designer time in services!

The event is entirely volunteer-driven. It’s a great opportunity for people to work together, develop new friendships, and do something important for the community. We’re looking for volunteers, both technical and non-technical, to help us do it.

But it will take more than the passion and expertise of our volunteers to make this happen. We need support to help provide a fun and rewarding environment for our volunteers.  Sponsors are an important part of ensuring that nonprofits receive what they need, both on the weekend and after, with no cost to participate.
