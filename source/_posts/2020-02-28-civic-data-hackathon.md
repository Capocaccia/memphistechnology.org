In this multi-day event, teams will work together to build innovative solutions around three themes:
<ul>
<li>Transportation and Mobility</li>
<li>Health and Safety</li>
<li>Neighborhoods & Census 2020</li>
</ul>

You also do NOT have to be a tech expert already to attend - this is a great opportunity for students or anyone interested in learning new skills to come tinker around in a fun environment with food, prizes, t-shirts, and even a DJ. This event is a team effort and our sponsors include the City of Memphis, CodeCrew, Innovate Memphis, StartCo, the FedEx Institute of Technology, Shelby County, and 901 Counts.
