Join us Friday, August 8th, for a cookout hosted by MidsouthMakers & HACKmemphis! We'll be cooking burgers and hotdogs from 6:30 until we run out or everyone is stuffed! Finish out a full day of #memtech events with us. 

Come hang out at the Memphis Hackerspace and see all the fun stuff we have going on. There are 3D printers, CNC machines, small electronics, and many more cool toys to see. 

Please RSVP in advance. BYOB. Feel free to bring desserts to share.
