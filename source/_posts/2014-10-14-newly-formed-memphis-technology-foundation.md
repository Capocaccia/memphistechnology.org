Newly formed Memphis Technology Foundation aims to foster growth in local tech community

Earlier this year, leaders in the Memphis technology community formed the new Memphis Technology Foundation (MTF). The goal: to help the city’s growing community of developers, designers, tinkerers and makers find new and unique ways to band together, learn and network. To accomplish this, MTF will be providing technological groups and events in the Memphis area with strategic resources including mentorship, speakers and content, venue contacts and financial sponsorships.

With a generous seed investment from HACKmemphis, a local nonprofit seeking to provide open-ended programming designed by developers for developers, MTF will first set its sights on the facilitation and sponsorship of the TechCamp Memphis event.

TechCamp Memphis, currently in its third year, is a one-day conference for design, development and marketing professionals in the Mid-South. This year’s event will be held on Saturday, Nov. 1, from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., at Southwest Tennessee Community College, and will feature speakers from across the metropolitan area.

“We’re thrilled to see the Memphis Technology Foundation join and support the community,” said Joe Ferguson,chairman of the HACKmemphis board. “Their mission aligns so well with our own that we couldn’t help but get them started with this seed investment. When there’s a need, the Memphis community can always be counted on to rise up and fill it."

The MTF board of directors is made up of community members who lead various technological groups around town.

“The formation of MTF stemmed from a desire to see what the community could do if it pooled its resources,” said Brian Swanson, co-chair of the MTF board. “We’ve successfully grown the community as separate entities, but I can’t wait to see what we can do as a unified force in Memphis.”
