<h2>How can you help GiveCamp?</h2>
<p>
The event is entirely volunteer-driven. It’s a great opportunity for people to work together, develop new friendships, and do something important for the community. We’re looking for volunteers, both technical and non-technical, to help us do it.
</p>
 </p>
But it will take more than the passion and expertise of our volunteers to make this happen. We need support to help provide a fun and rewarding environment for our volunteers.  Sponsors are an important part of ensuring that non-profits receive what they need, both on the weekend and after, with no cost to participate.
