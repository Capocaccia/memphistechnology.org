HACKmemphis is an organization that hosts a weekend hackathon event. We encourage developers and designers of any background (or technology) to come together to work on whatever projects interest them. HACKmemphis is a free form weekend of hacking on software and hardware projects.

HACKmemphis is organized by a group in Memphis comprised of developers, makers, hackers, and local tech community supporters. We all want to see the local tech scene in Memphis thrive. We are a mutual nonprofit organization. This is a nonprofit venture. All money raised goes directly into creating the best event possible.
