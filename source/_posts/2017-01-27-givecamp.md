<h2>GiveCamp Memphis 2017</h2>

GiveCamp Memphis 2017 is coming soon. If you haven’t heard, it’s the weekend of Feb 17th. GiveCamp is an awesome weekend event where local devs, designers, marketers, social media gurus, and other professionals band together to help provide non-profits with solutions ranging from websites to mobile apps to Excel spreadsheets. The weekend long event is a fantastic way to give back to the community and gain valuable experience. Here are just a few posts from past volunteers and charities about the great work that comes out of GiveCamp Memphis:

George Spake - Volunteer: <a href="https://georgespake.com/blog/give-camp-2016/" target="_blank">GiveCamp Memphis Demonstrates How Vibrant Memphis’ Tech Community Is</a><br />

If you want to volunteer, signup on Meetup here: <a href="http://meetu.ps/35Sky7" target="_blank">GiveCamp Memphis 2017</a>

GiveCamp needs volunteers with any and all skills from developers to marketers, at any level of expertise. Everyone is welcome, from the Senior level to the novice, and beyond. Even if your skills aren't in development, there's a good chance that one of the teams needs your help (we're looking at you, SEO specialists and project managers).

Show up Friday night, find a project that sounds interesting, and spend the weekend doing a good thing for a good cause!
